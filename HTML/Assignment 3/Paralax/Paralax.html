            <h2>About Paralax</h2>
            <p>Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background 
                content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than 
                the foreground content while scrolling. Click on the links

           <P><h1>What is parallax scrolling?</h1> <br>
            Parallax scrolling is a special scrolling technique used in web design where background images throughout a web page move slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth on a two-dimensional site.
            
            It is one of the most used design techniques in web design right now, but also something you probably donâ€™t even realize you have already experienced.
